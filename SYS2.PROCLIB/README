SYS2.PROCLIB

COBUCL2 is the member I created that cleans up the existing COBOL COMPILER. 

How to use it:

SIMPLY create a new member in the SYS2.PROCLIB as COBUCL2 
COPY and PASTE the records into the member and save it

In MJ.DEVREL01.BCOB(@COMPILE) 
  Use this job to input your BCOB member, COPYBOOK and Specify your LOAD Library and it will call COBUCL2 and build your LOAD.

Note: in MVS 3.8 USERS HERC01, HERC02, HERC03 all have HERC01.TEST.LOADLIB.
